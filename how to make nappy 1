Nappies, also known as baby absorbents, are designed to collect and manage liquid waste from babies. There are
many types of nappies, including cream nappies, bamboo nappies, and disposables. Here's a general guide on how to
use nappies:

### 1. **Choose the Right Nappy Type**
   - **Cream Nappies**: Folded or fitted nappies that provide good coverage and absorbency.
   - **Bamboo Nappies**: Known for being eco-friendly, soft, and effective at absorbing liquids.
   - **Disposable Nappies**: One-time use products designed for babies.

### 2. **Prepare the Nappy**
   - Clean the nappy with warm water and mild detergent. Avoid using fabric softeners as they can weaken the
nappy's absorbency.
   - Ensure the nappy is dry before use to prevent contamination.

### 3. **Change the Nappy**
   - **For Cream or Bamboo Nappies**:
     - Carefully slide the nappy under the baby, aligning it with the乐意 area.
     - Gently pull the elastic trim free of any debris.
     - Insert a nappy cover (optional) to keep the nappy dry and comfortable.

   - **For Disposable Nappies**:
     - Fold the disposable nappy in half along the fold line.
     - Slide it under the baby, matching the sides with the乐意 area.
     - Pull the elastic trim free of any debris.
     - Insert a nappy cover (optional) to keep the nappy dry and comfortable.

### 4. **Wipe the Baby**
   - Gently wipe the baby’s bottom with a clean cloth or wipe specifically designed for babies.
   - Ensure the wipes are dry before changing the nappy.

### 5. **Change the Nappy**
   - If the baby has soiled the nappy, change it as soon as possible to prevent contamination.
   - Clean the soiled area with warm water and mild detergent.
   - Dry the baby’s bottom thoroughly before putting on a new nappy.

### 6. **Disposal of Soiled Nappies**
   - For cream or bamboo nappies: Toss the soiled nappy in the trash. Do not flush them down the toilet as they
may clog the pipes.
   - For disposable nappies: Throw them into a dedicated bin or send them to a waste disposal facility.

### 7. **Clean and Dry**
   - Clean the nappy’s exterior with warm water and mild detergent, avoiding direct sun exposure which can cause
shrinkage.
   - Air dry or place in a mesh bag to air dry gently.

### 8. **Repeat the Process**
   - Continue using the same process until the baby outgrows the nappy.

### Tips:
- **Frequency**: Change nappies every few hours, depending on the baby’s activity level and tolerance.
- **Wash Care**: Follow the care instructions on the nappy package for optimal absorbency and hygiene.
- **Eco-Friendly Options**: Consider using bamboo or cloth nappies for a more sustainable choice.

Always ensure that the baby’s bottom is completely dry before putting on a new nappy to prevent rashes or
discomfort.
